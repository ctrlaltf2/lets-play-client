## Building
To build, have nodejs installed and run `npm install`. After that, run `npm run build`. This will update the bundle.js inside root/. If you want to build for development purposes, run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal. This will automatically build files in development mode to allow for debugging. Again, output will be to root/.
